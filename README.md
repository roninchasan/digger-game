# digger-game
A Java-backed game similar to the popular "Digger" franchise. The "digger" character must find the hidden coin (he is not aware of its location, as he hasn't "dug" close enough to see it yet), then collect as many coins as possible and exit the mine before his step count runs out. Code for GUI and game skeleton provided by Professors David Gries and Michael Clarkson at Cornell University. Functionality implemented by me, Ronin Chasan. Functionality includes movement of digger, ability to find the hidden coin, collecting as many coins as possible, and finding a shortest path to the exit.
